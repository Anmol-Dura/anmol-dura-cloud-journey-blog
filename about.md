Hi, I'm **Anmol** — recently graduated x-international student in Toronto, junior baker by day, cloud learner by night.
I write honest posts about:

- Cloud & DevOps (AWS, tooling, labs)
- Personal growth and discipline (gym, mindset, routines)
- Real life in Canada — work, study, and building a future
