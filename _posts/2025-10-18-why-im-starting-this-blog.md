I want a single place to **think in public** — to document my journey into cloud,
share real stories from my life in Toronto, and collect notes that might help
someone like me.

**What to expect**
- Honest posts about learning AWS and DevOps
- Personal reflections from work, gym, and daily life
- Project write-ups with code and lessons learned

Thanks for reading — let’s build.
